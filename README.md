Nibbit
======

JavaScript NBT encoder and decoder

Overview
--------

Nibbit is an easy to use encoder and decoder for the NBT serialisation format,
created for and popularised by the game "Minecraft". It'll decode uncompressed
NBT data only - decompression is your job.

Features
--------

1. Accurate encoding and decoding of most NBT tag types (see below for details)
2. Convenient AST generator functions
3. Asynchronous and streaming parser (thanks to [node-binary](https://github.com/substack/node-binary))

Bugs and Limitations
--------------------

1. Can't represent integers above 2^53 accurately due to JavaScript's numeric
   type being `double` all the time.
2. Can't encode arbitrary objects for the same reason. Not enough information
   is available about the numbers being encoded. All encoding has to be done
   on a specially constructed AST.

Documentation
-------------

Take a look at docs/ in the repo or [the same thing hosted on github](http://deoxxa.github.com/nibbit).
Please note that these are HTML files generated by [docco](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/)
so you can also just read the comments in the source files in lib/ if you like.

Example Usage
-------------

```javascript
var fs = require("fs"),
    zlib = require("zlib"),
    nibbit = require("nibbit");

// decoding
fs.readFile("./data/test.nbt", function(err, compressed) {
  zlib.gunzip(compressed, function(err, uncompressed) {
    nbt.decode(data, function(err, decoded) {
      console.log(decoded);
    });
  });
});

// encoding and manual AST construction
var ast = nbt.compound([
  nbt.string("Bananrama", "name"),
], "hello world");

nibbit.encode(ast, function(err, uncompressed) {
  console.log(uncompressed);
});
```
